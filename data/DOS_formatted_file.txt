This is an example DOS text file.

Notice the extra new line characters when viewed with cat -A.

Creating a file on Windows using DOS line breaks and uploading the file to
Linux is a constant source of pain. When you look at the file, everything
seems normal. But Linux commands will often read the file as one long line.
This breaks many things and causes trouble...

To convert a DOS file to Linux, use the dos2unix command:
  dos2unix file.text
